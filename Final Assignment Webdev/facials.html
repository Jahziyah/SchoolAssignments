                            <h3>Treatment Options & Benefits</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Bliss Glow Facial (75 min - $259):</strong> Bliss Glow, our signature facial, allows you to see immediate improvements in your skin's texture, tone, and appearance. Using special technology, the effervescent exfoliant transforms your skin inside and out. This treatment simultaneously exfoliates skin, removes impurities, oxygenates the skin using the Bohr Effect, and accelerates the absorption of peptides hyaluronic acid, and vitamins A, C, and E found in the cosmetics products used. Rejuvenate your cells and leave with radiant, beautiful skin with a fresh glow.</li>
                                <li><strong>Bro-Face | Men's Facial (60 minutes - $199)</strong> A tailored solution designed to cater to the unique needs of men's skin. We understand that men's skin requires specialized care due to its distinct composition. Compared to women, men's skin tends to be thicker, oilier, and more prone to issues such as acne and ingrown hairs. This knowledge informs every aspect of our treatment.</li>
                                <li><strong>Blemish Control (60 min - $199):</strong> Say goodbye to acne woes and hello to clearer, healthier skin with AMAN Spa's specially crafted “Blemish Control” facial treatment. This facial is meticulously designed to target the unique needs of acne-prone skin, leaving you with a radiant, blemish-free complexion that screams confidence.</li>
                                <li><strong>Bliss Ritual Facial (90 min - $299):</strong> More than just a facial, this 90-minute signature ritual is a complete mind-body-skin reset. Tailored to your individual skin needs, it blends the healing power of Omorovicza skincare with Face Pilates™ techniques, advanced red light therapy, and multi-masking for a deeply rejuvenating experience. The treatment begins with a sensory double cleanse and gentle exfoliation to refine and renew. Through a series of Face Pilates™ movements and rhythmic facial massage, tension is released, circulation is boosted, and the complexion is visibly revitalized. Each phase is thoughtfully customized—featuring layers of active Omorovicza masks to hydrate, brighten, and restore balance. Red light therapy enhances luminosity and supports collagen renewal, leaving skin glowing from within. To complete the experience, a soothing body massage for the arms, shoulders, neck, and scalp melts away residual stress and invites deep relaxation. You'll emerge grounded, radiant, and renewed—your skin refreshed, your mind restored.</li>

Your aesthetician will begin with a brief consultation to understand your skin type, concerns, and goals so they can fully customize your treatment. You'll then settle comfortably into a private treatment room with soft lighting, relaxing music, and a peaceful atmosphere.</p>
