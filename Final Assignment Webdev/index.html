                            <p>The staff were kind, accommodating, funny and so helpful. The space is absolutely gorgeous. It's not a big spa with amenities etc., but they took the massage clinic concept and made it gorgeous and luxurious. It definitely has the aesthetics of those larger spas, and that essence carries through with little touches like fruit infused water, snacks, and tea in their waiting area. I also appreciated the touches of mouth wash, mints, etc. in the treatment rooms. So lovely!</p>

                            <p>I had the signature Bliss Glow Facial with Amber and it was seriously the most incredible facial I have ever had. I needed something to plump and make my skin glow again after being run down at work and my skin looked terrible. I can't believe the immediate results from just 75 minutes with her. The techniques were so unique and you could really feel them working. I love Bliss Spa because it's no fuss, you are in and out without waiting long or being distracted by other guests and unnecessary amenities that the oversized spas have. I love Bliss Spa and cannot wait to come back!</p>

                            <p>I booked a manicure with Miranda. Really beautiful space but only one washroom, luckily my appointment was for 7:30 so not a busy time. Never had a manicure before so this was really nice. My first time visiting Bliss. Miranda was great at describing everything she was going to do in the appointment and ensuring I was comfortable with everything. I had a great time and would recommend this treatment.</p>
